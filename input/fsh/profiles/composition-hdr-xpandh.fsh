These observations are based on analysis of specimens obtained from the patient and submitted to the laboratory. Imaging results are typically generated by a clinician reviewing the output of an imaging procedure, such as when a cardiologist reports the left ventricular ejection fraction based on the review of an echocardiogram. Procedure results are typically generated by a clinician wanting to provide more granular information about component observations made during the performance of a procedure, such as when a gastroenterologist reports the size of a polyp observed during a colonoscopy.
